Note: As you can see, most of the events are in Europe because most of the core team members are from Europe. If you would be willing to help us expand Web3Privacy Now Events to other regions, we would be very happy to do so! Please get in touch, ideally on [Matrix](https://matrix.web3privacy.info/).
